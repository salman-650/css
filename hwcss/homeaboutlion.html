🦁 Lion – The King of the Jungle

Lions are powerful and majestic animals known for their golden manes and thunderous roars. They live in groups called prides and are often called the “King of the Jungle”, even though they usually live in grasslands and savannas.

Male lions are known for their thick manes, while female lions (lionesses) are expert hunters who work together to catch prey. Lions can sleep up to 20 hours a day, and their roar can be heard from 5 miles (8 km) away!
